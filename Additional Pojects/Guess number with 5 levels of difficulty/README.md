 First of all the console prints the level of the game, then it wants you to guess a number (in given range).When you write a number the game checks if you guessed it right or not and prints "Too Low!" if you number is lower,"Too High!" if you number is higher and "You guesed it!" if you managed to get it right.

If you enter an invalid input(a letter, etc.) the console prints "Invalid input." and wants you to enter a new VALID number.
