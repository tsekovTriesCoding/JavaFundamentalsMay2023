One popular expansion of the classic "rock,scissors,paper" game is "rock-paper-scissors-Spock-lizard", invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, which adds "Spock" and "lizard" to the standard three choices. "Spock" is signified with the Star Trek Vulcan salute, while "lizard" is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth.
Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproved by paper.
Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors.
This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article in The Times of London and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom The Big Bang Theory in 2008 (as rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock).

Rules of the game:
+ '+'means that the row player "beats", '-' means "is beaten" and 'O' means tie.
